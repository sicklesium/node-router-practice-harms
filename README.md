# Quotes DB Exercise

A gremlin has deleted vital parts of the quotes api. We need you to put it back together asap!

The gremlin removed all the routing information in `quotes-router.js`, all the global middleware from `server.js`, and the command for the server to listen in `index.js`. It even deleted at least one required package! Can you get this back up and running before the end of TL hours? (yes)
